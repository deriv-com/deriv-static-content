Release to production:

Releasing to production requires a tag using the following format:

`production_VYYYYMMDD_${Integer}` --- Integer is the release version

Example of release steps

-   Create the tag following today's date

    ```sh
    git tag production_V20220906_0 -m 'release to production'
    ```

-   Push the tag to the main repository

    ```sh
    git push upstream production_V20220906_0
